# pyramid_solitaire

This is a C++ program called pyramid solitaire that I wrote, just for fun, as extra practice for C++. The rules are simple, click and drag cards together to make matches. Each legal match adds up to 13, with 2-10 cards with value of their number, Jack is 11, Queen is 12, King is 13 (and therefore counts as a pair by itself), and Ace is 1. You can also use the discard pile to make matches. Try to clear the entire pyramid.

Hotkeys:

"D" = re-Deal

"M" = shows winning "card-burst" animation (hit any key to stop)

These instructions are for Linux. To start program, download all of the code. From the command line enter the 'bin' directory. Then run with command './prog'. Otherwise you can enter the bin directory and type 'make', let it build the program, then type './prog'.
